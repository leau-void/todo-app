# todo-app

Live : https://leau-void.github.io/todo-app/

This is a todo list app made with Vanilla JS for The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript path.

I wanted to get used to stric style guides, so I tried following the Javascript Standard Style guide.

This project helped me practice webpack, npm, ES6 modules, separation of logic and display, factory functions, object manipulation, using local storage, and I tried adding in a nice responsive mobile design.
